/**
 * Passkey Authentication Test Flow
 * 
 * This script provides a structured approach to manually test the WebAuthn passkey
 * authentication implementation. Run through these steps to verify all aspects
 * of the authentication system.
 */

/**
 * TEST 1: PASSKEY REGISTRATION
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that new users can register with a passkey
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. Open the application in a browser that supports WebAuthn (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
 * 2. Click the "Register" button in the header
 * 3. Enter a username (e.g., "testuser123")
 * 4. Optionally enter a display name (e.g., "Test User")
 * 5. Click "Register with Passkey"
 * 6. Follow the browser's prompts to create a passkey (may involve biometric verification)
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Browser should prompt to create a passkey
 * - After successful registration, user should be logged in automatically
 * - The AuthButton should display the user's information
 * - Protected content (ImageGallery and ImageGenerator) should be visible
 * 
 * Error Cases to Test:
 * - Try registering with an empty username (button should be disabled)
 * - Try registering with a username that already exists (should show error message)
 * - Cancel the passkey creation process (should return to form without logging in)
 */

/**
 * TEST 2: AUTHENTICATION WITH REGISTERED PASSKEY
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that registered users can authenticate with their passkey
 * 
 * Steps:
 * 1. If logged in, click "Logout" from the user menu
 * 2. Click the "Login" button in the header
 * 3. Enter the previously registered username
 * 4. Click "Authenticate with Passkey"
 * 5. Follow the browser's prompts to use your passkey
 * 
 * Expected Results:
 * - Browser should prompt to use the existing passkey
 * - After successful authentication, user should be logged in
 * - The AuthButton should display the user's information
 * - Protected content should be visible
 * 
 * Error Cases to Test:
 * - Try authenticating with an empty username (button should be disabled)
 * - Try authenticating with a username that doesn't exist (should show error message)
 * - Cancel the passkey authentication process (should return to form without logging in)

/**
 * TEST 3: ERROR HANDLING SCENARIOS
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that the system handles errors gracefully
 * 
 * Test 3.1: Network Error
 * 1. Disconnect from the internet
 * 2. Attempt to register or login
 * 3. Expected: Should show an appropriate error message
 * 
 * Test 3.2: Server Error
 * 1. If you have access to the server code, modify it to return a 500 error
 * 2. Attempt to register or login
 * 3. Expected: Should show an appropriate error message
 * 
 * Test 3.3: Unsupported Browser
 * 1. Open the application in an older browser that doesn't support WebAuthn
 * 2. Attempt to register or login
 * 3. Expected: Should show an appropriate error message about browser compatibility
 * 
 * Test 3.4: Multiple Devices
 * 1. Register on one device
 * 2. Try to authenticate on a different device
 * 3. Expected: Should prompt for passkey or show appropriate message
 */

/**
 * TEST 4: PROTECTED CONTENT ACCESS
 * 
 * Purpose: Verify that authentication properly protects content
 * 
 * Test 4.1: Unauthenticated Access
 * 1. Ensure you're logged out
 * 2. Observe the UI
 * 3. Expected: Protected components (ImageGallery and ImageGenerator) should be hidden or show authentication required message
 * 
 * Test 4.2: Authentication Expiration
 * 1. Login successfully
 * 2. If possible, manually expire the token (edit localStorage or wait for expiration)
 * 3. Refresh the page or trigger a verification check
 * 4. Expected: User should be logged out and protected content hidden
 * 
 * Test 4.3: Token Persistence
 * 1. Login successfully
 * 2. Refresh the page
 * 3. Expected: User should remain logged in and protected content visible
 * 
 * Test 4.4: Manual Logout
 * 1. Login successfully
 * 2. Click "Logout" from the user menu
 * 3. Expected: User should be logged out and protected content hidden
 */

/**
 * AUTOMATED TESTING CONSIDERATIONS
 * 
 * For automated testing of WebAuthn:
 * 
 * 1. Use a virtual authenticator in Puppeteer or Playwright:
 *    - Playwright: await page.evaluate(() => window.navigator.credentials.create({...}))
 *    - Puppeteer: await page.evaluateHandle(() => navigator.credentials.create({...}))
 * 
 * 2. Mock the WebAuthn API for unit tests:
 *    - Mock startRegistration and startAuthentication functions
 *    - Test component behavior with different response scenarios
 * 
 * 3. Test the auth service with mocked fetch responses:
 *    - Mock successful and failed API responses
 *    - Verify proper error handling and state updates
